## Level 1

### What it looks like
Understanding of a language's syntax.

Familiarity of the language's development environment. e.g. IDE, other tooling, operating system

### Resources

## Level 2

### What it looks like
Knowing what the idiomatic form of a language looks like

Being aware of best practices that are applicable to a language

Proficiency in intermediate to advanced language features. Examples:
- in Swift, smart key paths, pattern matching capabilities

Proficiency in intermediate to advanced toolings for a language. Examples:
- advanced debugging like memory debuggers
- performance tuning features

Understanding of more nuanced aspects of a language and being able to articulate the trade off between different approaches. Examples:
- Swift: what's the difference between `struct` and a `class`? Where would you use either?

### Resources

## Level 3

### What it looks like
Understanding of what makes best practices, well, best practices

Ability to design APIs well. Some signs of well designed APIs are:
- Simplicity. Having sensible interfaces instead of chatty ones
- Stability. Less breaking changes are required on the public interfaces
Of course the term "API" here refers to module interfaces, not necessarily restricted to the web.

Being able to solve problems in a generalised way. An example would be the use of generic language features to reduce boilerplate etc.

Knowledge of how to set up a complex application, with external dependencies and a reasonable amount of code

Being aware of what a language's evolution process is like, i.e. know what's in development, what's upcoming etc.

Proficient in advanced language features of a language
- in Swift, closures, reference vs value types, ownership model
- in C#, reflection

### Resources

## Level 4

### What it looks like
Knowing what a language is good at, and what it isn't. Thereby being able to make technical decisions on the impact of adoption, for example.

Being able to contribute to a major update/rewrite of a complex application

Can teach a language well

### Resources

## Level 5

### What it looks like
Being able to lead a major update/rewrite of a complex application

Able to contribute meaningful features back to the language itself (where applicable)
