Example Tasks Performed
- With guidance understood a build pipeline and worked on aspects of it.

### Resources

## Level 2

### What it looks like

Example Behaviours and Skills
- Understands how to automate builds using build server of choice
- Can be largely autonomous, only needing assistance with new complex pipelines or very complex problems.
- Understands testing requirements, and can implement based on required specifications

Example Tasks Performed
- Used tools to solve software development lifecycle issues
- Created new simple pipelines based on previous examples
- Operated, maintained and supported delivery pipelines


### Resources

## Level 3

### What it looks like

Example Behaviours and Skills
- Takes a lead on design, consultation, stakeholder engagement
- Takes a lead in the documentation of pipelines
- Understands that not all problems can be solved with tools, and that there is an essential human element
- Can compare and contrast various tradeoffs in pipeline design (speed vs reliability, test coverage, etc)
- Has a good awareness of industry best practices


Example Tasks Performed
- Created tools to solve software development lifecycle issues
- Automated software development lifecycle beyond build (code quality, insight, testing)
- Reviewed and refined existing pipelines to improve or remove complexity.
- Identified obstacles that prevent greater adoption of CI/CD
- Designed holistic app and infra pipelines from scratch
- Assisted in the training, and upskilling of other members of the team
- Add a more advanced testing item here
