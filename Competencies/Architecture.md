# Architecture
![Ready](../Images/rocket.png) Ready for Use  

The design and communication of high-level structures to enable and guide the design and development of software solutions that meet current and future business needs. 

Things like
- Security, Availability, Robustness, Integration
- Integration, Logical and Physical placement 
- Cost and Ownership Maintenance
- Problem analysis, generalization
- Option-enumeration, weighting, comparison
- Requirement gathering and scoping
- Knowledge of architectural and Software Design Patterns

- Has an understanding of group specific infrastructure architecture guidelines
- Can read and understand an infrastructure design document

### Resources

## Level 2

### What it looks like
- Can appreciate an architectural design in the roadmap context
- Contributing to;
    - Requirement gathering
    - Option presentation
    - Design
    - Implementation
    - Operational transition planning

### Resources
- Read [Head First Design Patterns - Sierra](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly/dp/0596007124)
- Read through old TKO documents and other projects architecture documents

## Level 3

### What it looks like
- Being able to communicate design decisions and the reasoning behind them
- Owning / Producing Design documents
- Technical Scoping of the design solution, alligning to current roadmap.
- Generalisation of Problem set, to support further/wider roadmap decisions.
- Project level implementation planning
- Awareness of NFRs (Security, Scalability, Performance, Resilence etc) and considering these while doing application design 


### Resources

- Spend time with Architect learning more about what architects do.
- Document the system that they are working with - try to work out why the features were built that way, trade-offs etc.
- Lead a TKO

## Level 4

### What it looks like

### Resources

## Level 5

### What it looks like
- Identified and solved systemic problems with current architecture
- Able to visualize and design complex systems with multiple product lines and integrations with external systems. Also should be able to design operations support systems like monitoring, reporting, fail overs etc.

- Ownership, maintenance, and allignment of the current roadmap with business priorities.
- Identifying opportunities from current challenges and building the future infrastructure roadmap.
- Advising on technical priorities with Delivery management on NFR projects.
- Takes ownership of architectural guidelines, and encouraging engagement and uptake
