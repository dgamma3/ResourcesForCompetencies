A very good place to start learning about the Swift language. Apple makes sure that it's kept up to date with language changes. You can also find the iBooks version [here](https://itunes.apple.com/au/book/the-swift-programming-language-swift-4-2/id881256329?mt=11).

### [Swift Playgrounds for iPad](https://developer.apple.com/swift-playgrounds/)
This is a great little programming game to get yourself familiarised with the basics.

### [Swift tutorials on raywenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com/6338-swift-tutorial-part-1-expressions-variables-and-constants)
raywenderlich.com has a good collection of tutorials on the language, as well as the application of it, mostly in iOS and macOS.

## Level 2

This book also contains more advanced topics in Swift like generics.

### [Swift Forums](https://forums.swift.org/)
This is a very active forum being maintained by the Swift team itself. The topics are very wide ranging.

### [Apple's WWDC videos](https://developer.apple.com/videos/all-videos/)
This is a large collection of videos spanning years of WWDC. Swift is only one part of the contents.

### [Realm Academy](https://academy.realm.io/section/apple/)
[Realm](realm.io) hosts quite a lot of talks, and most of them are not even about promoting Realm!

### [Objc.io talks](https://talk.objc.io/)
Brought to you by the authors of the App Architecture book. Some talks are only available to subscribers. Xero has a subscription, speak to the iOS team to get access!

### [Swift by Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/)
John Sundell has a lot of good content around development in general.

### [Swift Unwrapped](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped)
A podcast focusing specifically on Swift.

### [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)
A linter that's used to enforce style rules and best practices.

## Level 3
### [Kickstarter iOS app](https://github.com/kickstarter/ios-oss)
Kickstarter's iOS app is open source, and it's all in Swift. Go and have a snoop!

### [App Architecture book](https://www.objc.io/books/app-architecture/)
This is a well reviewed book written by some of the most well known developers in the community. The contents are well worth the read.

## Level 4
### [Swift evolution](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution)
This is the place to go to when you are interested in the evolution of Swift (hence the name), as well as contributing to it. Check out the [proposals](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/tree/master/proposals) folder for a list of all the formal proposals made to Swift. This is very useful to get an idea of the upcoming features, as well as influencing the direction of the language. All you have to do is open a PR :)

## Level 5
### [Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift)
The language itself! Have a look, pull it down, fix a bug! The possibilities are... numerous.
