# Possible Duplicates
- Is coaching same as growing people?
- Is time management and prioritisation same as self direction



## Thoughts...

- Roles are entry criteria (and in role)
- Should all competencies have 5 levels? 
- Competency is the ability to do something successfully or efficiently (Chambers dictionary)
- Competencies are made up of knowledge, skills and attitude 
    - Should what it looks like be composed of behaviours and tasks like Medium framework
- Primary and Secondary competencies which are mandatory/optional
- Are there minimum levels for specific roles? Feels like there should be.
- Tools later on
- Junior, Mid level, Senior and Lead Developers may need separate competency pages


## Example frameworks used
- OECD
- Medium
- Patreon
- CGMA (Leadership skills)
- https://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/careers/behavioural_competencies/mg_dictionary.html

## Criteria
- Must be objective and observable


## Competency Architecture

```
A typical set of rules for one organization’s competency profile development is:

Up to 12 competencies per profile, including five (5) core competencies.
Core Competencies – 5 competencies that apply to all employees
Job Family Competencies – Common to whole family
Technical / Professional (work specific) Competencies - Apply to some or all jobs / roles in group

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competency_architecture#Example_guideline
```

```
 Each competency includes up to five proficiency levels and each level has an associated brief statement describing how that particular level is distinct from the other levels within that competency.
