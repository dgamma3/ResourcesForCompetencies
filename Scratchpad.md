- Are these competencies?

## Thoughts...
- Should all competencies have 5 levels? 
- Competency is the ability to do something successfully or efficiently (Chambers dictionary)
- Competencies are made up of knowledge, skills and attitude 
    - Should what it looks like be composed of behaviours and tasks like Medium framework
- Primary and Secondary competencies which are mandatory/optional
- Are there minimum levels for specific roles? Feels like there should be.
- Tools later on
- Junior, Mid level, Senior and Lead Developers may need separate competency pages


## Example frameworks used
- OECD
- Medium
