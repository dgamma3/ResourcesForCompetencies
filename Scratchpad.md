# Scratch Pad

- Are these competencies?
    - Problem solving
    - adaptability
    - resilience, perserverance, patience, persistence
    - Collaboration/team orientation
    - Customer focus
    - result focus -> self direction?
    - planning and organising
    - business awareness?
    - Analytical thinking?
    - Interviewing, hiring and onboarding?
    - Evangelism/outreach

    - Supporting applications in production?
        - logging, monitoring, sumologic
        - Understanding infrastructure
        - Debugging techniques
    - Innovation?


## Thoughts...
- Should all competencies have 5 levels? 
- Competency is the ability to do something successfully or efficiently (Chambers dictionary)
- Competencies are made up of knowledge, skills and attitude 
    - Should what it looks like be composed of behaviours and tasks like Medium framework
- Primary and Secondary competencies which are mandatory/optional
- Are there minimum levels for specific roles? Feels like there should be.
- Tools later on
- Junior, Mid level, Senior and Lead Developers may need separate competency pages


## Example frameworks used
- OECD
- Medium
- Patreon


## Criteria
- Must be objective and observable


## Competency Architecture

```
A typical set of rules for one organization’s competency profile development is:

Up to 12 competencies per profile, including five (5) core competencies.
Core Competencies – 5 competencies that apply to all employees
Job Family Competencies – Common to whole family
Technical / Professional (work specific) Competencies - Apply to some or all jobs / roles in group

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competency_architecture#Example_guideline
```

```
 Each competency includes up to five proficiency levels and each level has an associated brief statement describing how that particular level is distinct from the other levels within that competency.
