# Competencies

## Disclaimer
*This is very much a work in progress* - If you disagree with how we have assessed competency, assumed competencies for your role or anything else - feel free to raise a PR (or email me if you don't use Github).

## What is this?
- It is a career growth tool to help people have good career growth and career change conversation.
- It is a crowd sourced set of resources to help people grow.
- It might be useful as an interviewing tool.
- It could be used as a capability uplift tool or possibly even a curriculum.

## What is a Competency?
Competency is the ability to do something successfully or efficiently (Chambers dictionary)

## Assessing Competency Level
When assessing competency at a level you need to consider the 5 Cs..

- Conscious: having devoted intentional effort to this endeavour,
- Comfortable: without being overly stretched,
- Continuous: for a reasonable period of time,
- Consistent: reliably and evenly,
- Competency: meeting the criteria.

Overall, if it is not clear that an person is at a given milestone, they are at the previous milestone.
