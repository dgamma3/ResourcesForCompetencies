# Competencies

## Disclaimer
*This is very much a work in progress* - If you disagree with how we have assessed competency, assumed competencies for your role or anything else - feel free to raise a PR (or email me if you don't use Github).

## What is this?
- It is a career growth tool to help people have good career growth and career change conversation.
- It is a crowd sourced set of resources to help people grow.
- It might be useful as an interviewing tool.
- It could be used as a capability uplift tool or possibly even a curriculum.
